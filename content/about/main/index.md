  I'm glad you stopped by. I am a researcher, designer, and educator who enjoys making data science projects feel beautiful and friendly. I work at RStudio to develop user experiences that help teams do more with their data. 
  
  Through my PhD research in neuroscience, I became interested in the best ways to teach complex topics and empower learners. One of my favorite examples of this is my co-authored project [Teacup, Giraffes, & Statistics](../../my-project/external-project/teacups), which leverages illustration, web design, and R Markdown to teach statistical principles with tiny giraffes. Over the past several years, I have continued to design websites, instructional content, and novel learning platforms to making learning data science and R an intuitive experience.

  When I'm not coding or teaching, I work on mixed media illustration, some of which have been featured on the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05g73l9/p05g71m6) [programs](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0952zlc), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2017/feb/11/small-is-beautiful-art-from-tiny-objects?page=with%3Aimg-2), editorials, and advertising campaigns for Hewlett Packard and 20th Century Fox. You can also find my illustrations on [RStudio's education website](https://education.rstudio.com/).
