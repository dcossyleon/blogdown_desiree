  I'm a data scientist and neuroscientist based in Atlanta. I'm a data science educator at RStudio, where I develop resources for learning data science with R. I enjoy using R Markdown, illustration, and web design to work on projects that make complex topics feel friendly and less intimidating -- my favorite example of this is my co-authored project [Teacup, Giraffes, & Statistics](../../my-project/external-project/teacups), which is all about teaching stats basics with tiny giraffes. 

  When I'm not coding, I create mixed media illustrations. My work has been featured in international media outlets, including the BBC, The Guardian, and the French newspaper group Le Monde, as well as in campaigns for Hewlett Packard and 20th Century Fox.
